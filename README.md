## Abstract
Firstly, we would like to accumulate data for the top 25 cryprocurrencies.  We intend to gather all this data through coinmarketcap's API.  As a next step, we will evaluate and interperet the data trying to identify market trends which influenced the rise and fall of the currencies and identifying correlations between different coins.  From here, we will investigate what insights this data can have of the future then develop multiple models to compare their effectiveness and accuracy.

## Technologies
* Git: for team collaboration
* Python
   * Numpy: creating and manipulating multi-dimensional arrays and matrices
   * Pandas: data gathering, manipulation, and analysis
   * Matplotlib: data visualization
   * Scikit-learn: machine learning
   * Likely more packages as needed

## Project Schedule:
### Week 1:
* Create a project idea and form group.

### Week 2:
* Create the README file on Github and schedule weekly group meeting time to work on project.

### Week 3:
* Start compiling and cleaning data
* Get prices for stock market and cryptocurrencies

### Weeks 4-6:
* Exploratory data analysis
* Correlations between price changes of different cryptocurrencies
* Look at cryptocurrency price changes in relation to stock market dips
* How do different cryptocurrencies recover from dips?

### Weeks 7 and On:
* Model Building
* Time series analysis
* Logistic Regression
* LSTM Neural Networks
